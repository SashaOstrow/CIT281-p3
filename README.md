# Overview

For this project, you will be creating the "Ultimate Coin Tool" web application with two basic capabilities:

    Calculating all possible US coin combinations given a specific target number of pennies
    Calculating the value in pennies of a specific number of each of the available US coins.


This project focused on building a full-featured **Node.js** web application using **modular programming**, **RESTful API design with Express**, and a **static frontend interface**. The goal was to implement a coin calculator that supports both value calculation and coin combination generation.
